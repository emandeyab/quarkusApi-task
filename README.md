- Retrieve all products or a specific product by ID.
- Update an existing product's details.
- Delete a product by ID.

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher.
- Maven (for building the project).
- Postman (for testing the API).

## Running the application
You can run the application in dev mode that enables live coding using: 

   ```./mvnw quarkus:dev``` or  ```mvn quarkus:dev```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
